1)	“SP Medication” table: MSC should be char(1) ? YES

2)	Let’s briefly discuss the reason for "Client" table and review the fields.

3)	"Reject Codes and Messages" table. Should the "Carrier ID" type stay char(255) or should it be changed to char(9)? YES....  Also, the Reject code field is char(3) (not a number), is it correct ? YES leave it alpha-numeric

4)	“Index Medication” table: check the types of the numeric fields "R-* and M-*, they are all currently char(255). Is it Correct or should it be changed to some numeric? NUMERIC WITH DECIMAL, how many decimal digits (3?).

5)	Sample data (Alias, Rejected, Alt Exception, Index Med) would be nice.

6)	Last time it was mentioned that we’d get 9 tables. We got 7. Is it final, or are more tables coming?  (Is “Alternative Inclusion” a candidate to split into 3 tables?)

7)	match up the table names. As of today, we were coding for the following 7 tables names:

Alias List
Specialty Medication List
Reporting CAG Table (CLIENT)
Reject Code Messages Master List
Alternative File
CAG to Formulary Mapping - deferred
Drug List - == INDEX MEDICATION

We got the following 7 tables:

Alias
SP Medication
Client
Rejected Codes and Messages
Alternative Exception
Alternative Inclusion
Index Medication

Compare these 2 lists, match what matches and agree on the table names
